/**
 * The boot smoke: start each server the way a user's client does, over every
 * transport it implements, and ask it for one thing (#4871).
 *
 *   node scripts/smoke-servers.mjs            # every server
 *   node scripts/smoke-servers.mjs time git   # just the named ones
 *   npm run smoke                             # the root entry point (all)
 *
 * For each server and transport it connects an MCP client, lists the tools,
 * and calls one of them: stdio for all seven servers, plus HTTP+SSE and
 * Streamable HTTP for `everything`, the only server that serves them.
 *
 * Why it exists when every server has a test suite: the suites import the
 * source. Nothing in them runs the artifact a user actually launches, which is
 * the built `dist/index.js` behind the npm `bin` (TypeScript) or the console
 * script from `[project.scripts]` (Python). A wrong `bin` path, a file missing
 * from the build, a lost shebang, an import that only resolves under the test
 * runner, or a server that dies during the `initialize` handshake all pass the
 * unit tests and fail here. That is the whole of its job, so it is deliberately
 * thin: one tool per server, chosen to need nothing outside the machine.
 *
 * Why one Node script for both languages: the smoke is a client, and the
 * question it asks is the same whatever the server is written in. The Python
 * servers are launched through `uv run --no-sync`, never pip.
 *
 * `--no-sync` because the smoke tests an environment, it does not build one. A
 * plain `uv run` (even `--frozen`, which only stops the lockfile being
 * rewritten) creates the server's `.venv` and downloads into it when it is
 * missing or stale, which would make this stage a second, unannounced install
 * step. So each Python server must already be synced: `validate:py` does that
 * in the gate just before the smoke, and CI's smoke job has a sync step. A
 * server with no `.venv` is reported as that.
 *
 * The servers themselves are given nothing outside the machine to talk to, and
 * none of the user's files. `fetch` is pointed at an HTTP server this script
 * starts on the loopback interface; `git` and `filesystem` get a throwaway
 * directory; `memory` gets a throwaway graph file. The HTTP transports listen
 * on a port the OS reported free a moment earlier, not the server's default
 * 3001, so the smoke does not collide with a server the developer has running.
 * That port is not reserved between the probe and the server's own `listen`,
 * so a launch whose server reports the port taken is relaunched on a fresh
 * one. Streamable HTTP reports it; HTTP+SSE does not yet (#4923: it prints
 * "Server is running" either way), so there a lost port is a failed smoke.
 *
 * One server failing does not stop the rest: the run reports every target's
 * verdict and exits non-zero if any failed, so one run shows the whole picture.
 *
 * A TypeScript server must already be built (the gate builds before it smokes;
 * on its own, run `npm run build` first). A missing `dist/` is reported as
 * that, rather than as a server that failed to start.
